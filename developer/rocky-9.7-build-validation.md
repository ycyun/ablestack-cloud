# Rocky 9.8 Build Validation

## Policy Note

This document is now a technical reference only.

- The operational source of truth is [build-release-policy.ko.md](/Users/dhslove/Documents/GitHub/dhslove/ablestack-cloud/developer/build-release-policy.ko.md).
- Official development builds and release builds must use GitHub Actions.
- Local builds must not be used as the standard delivery path.

## Goal

- Validate that this repository can build and package on Rocky Linux 9.8.
- Prefer GitHub-hosted, serverless packaging over local workstation packaging.
- Keep a local reproduction path for macOS maintainers when a container runtime is available.

## Current Local Constraint

- This workstation is macOS.
- At the time this document was prepared, no local container runtime was installed:
  - `docker`
  - `podman`
  - `colima`
  - `lima`

That means Rocky 9.8 runtime validation cannot currently be executed directly on this machine without first adding a container or VM layer.

## Recommended Validation Path

Use GitHub Actions as the source of truth for Rocky 9.8 packaging validation.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/rocky97-rpm.yml`
- Build helper inside the container: `tools/build/rocky97-rpm-build.sh`
- Packaging entry point: `packaging/package.sh --distribution rocky9`

This path is preferred because:

- it matches the final delivery target: serverless GitHub Actions packaging
- it avoids macOS-specific drift
- it pins the Rocky 9.8 base image source
- it uploads generated RPMs and build logs as workflow artifacts

## Rocky 9.8 Container Source

The workflow downloads the official Rocky Linux 9.8 container archive and verifies its checksum before running the build.

- Archive:
  - `https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9.8/images/x86_64/Rocky-9-Container-Base.latest.x86_64.tar.xz`
- SHA256:
  - `1210df99dcf0ef4d73940244e6d703935175629598b09c0e430da20e76768402`

## Packaging Notes

- `packaging/package.sh` now accepts `rocky9` as a distribution alias.
- The alias currently reuses the existing `centos8` spec assets.
- This keeps the Rocky 9.8 packaging path explicit without duplicating the spec tree before a dedicated Rocky 9 spec is needed.

## Node and Java Handling

The Rocky 9.8 helper intentionally pins toolchains inside the container:

- Java:
  - installs both `java-11-openjdk-devel` and `java-17-openjdk-devel`
  - uses Java 17 for the Maven build path
- Node:
  - installs Rocky-provided `nodejs` to satisfy RPM build dependencies
  - prepends a pinned Node.js tarball to `PATH`
  - default pinned version: `14.21.3`

This is deliberate because the repository's existing UI workflow still builds with Node 14, while Rocky 9.8 can expose a newer system Node stream.

## GitHub Actions Usage

### Manual run

Run the `Rocky 9.8 RPM Packaging` workflow with `workflow_dispatch`.

Supported inputs:

- `pack`
  - `oss`
  - `noredist`
- `simulator`
  - `default`
  - `simulator`
- `release`
  - optional RPM release override
- `templates`
  - optional template list such as `kvm,xen,vmware`
- `node_version`
  - optional Node.js override; default is `14.21.3`

### Automatic run

The workflow also runs for pull requests that touch:

- `packaging/**`
- `tools/build/rocky97-rpm-build.sh`
- `ui/**`
- `pom.xml`
- `.github/workflows/rocky97-rpm.yml`

## Artifacts

The workflow uploads:

- `dist/rpmbuild/RPMS/**/*.rpm`
- `dist/rpmbuild/SRPMS/**/*.rpm`
- `dist/rocky97-build/build.log`
- `dist/rocky97-build/environment.txt`
- `dist/rocky97-build/artifacts.txt`

## Historical Local Reproduction on macOS

If local runtime validation is ever needed for debugging only, the least disruptive path is:

1. Install a container runtime on macOS.
2. Download and verify the same Rocky 9.8 container archive used by CI.
3. Load it into Docker-compatible runtime.
4. Run the same helper script inside the container.

Example shape:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --workdir /workspace \
  -e DISTRO=rocky9 \
  -e PACK=oss \
  -e NODE_VERSION=14.21.3 \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  ablestack/rocky97-build:latest \
  bash -lc './tools/build/rocky97-rpm-build.sh'
```

## Validation Status

- Build path design: prepared
- Rocky 9.8 GitHub Actions workflow: added
- Rocky 9.8 in-container helper: added
- macOS local execution: not run on this workstation because no container runtime is installed yet
- GitHub Actions runtime execution: pending first workflow run
